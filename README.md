# Diffusion Chat
I wrote this website in ~2.5 hours as a proof of concept. It uses the Stability AI REST API to deliver images quickly in a chat-like fashion. I like it, you might too. You can see a liver version of the site at https://diffusion.chat

## Contributing
Just make a PR. If I like it it will probably be merged. ;)
